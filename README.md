I'm SÄ±la, an Electronics and Communication Engineer with a strong passion for robotics and intelligent systems. From **underwater robots** to **autonomous vehicles**, I love building hands-on systems that bring together software and hardware to solve real-world challenges.   

My main interests lie in **robot perception** (with a focus on computer vision) and **reinforcement learning**, particularly how these areas enable robots to understand, learn, and adapt to their environment â€” inspired by *I, Robot* ðŸ¤–
