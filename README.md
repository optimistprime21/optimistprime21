## Hello World ðŸ‘‹

I'm SÄ±la, an Electronics and Communication Engineer with a strong passion for robotics and intelligent systems. From underwater robots to autonomous vehicles, I love building hands-on systems that bring together software and hardware to solve real-world challenges.   

My main interests lie in robot perception (with a focus on computer vision) and reinforcement learning, particularly how these areas enable robots to understand, learn, and adapt to their environment.
